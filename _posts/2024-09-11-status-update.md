After four rewarding years as a Software Developer at Citi, I’m thrilled to share that I’ve been accepted into the Master’s in Artificial Intelligence program at the prestigious University of Edinburgh!

Exploring the field of AI has always been a dream of mine, and I’m incredibly excited to delve deeper into this fascinating domain and discover what I can create with it.

If you’re also a student or just interested in AI, feel free to say hi! You can find my contact details on the <a href="/about/">about page.</a>
